#Longterm relative frequency of probability Visualisation
-After my first semester, I started a project based on my programming module to demonstrate the
long-term relative frequency of probability, a topic taught in Statistics. Using Python, I simulated
thousands of dice rolls and visualized the results with Matplotlib. This project showed how the probability
of each die outcome approaches 1/6 as the number of rolls increases, validating the Law of Large
Numbers.

## Features

- Roll a die multiple times and store the outcomes.
- Visualize the relative frequency of each die face using a bar chart.
- Display the data of all die rolls.
- Show statistical information about the die rolls.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib` library
- `pandas` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install matplotlib pandas

## Usage
1. Run the program:
2. Follow the on-screen menu to select an option:
  Roll die: Roll the die a specified number of times.
  Visual representation: Display a bar chart showing the relative frequency of each die face.
  Show data: Print the list of all die rolls.
  Show stats: Display statistical information about the die rolls.
  Exit: Exit the program.
